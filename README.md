# Project Title: Triple MNIST

## About
Triple MNIST is a research project aimed at exploring the concept of extending the traditional MNIST dataset to include three different variations of handwritten digits. While the original MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, our project extends this concept by introducing three variations: rotated digits, scaled digits, and noisy digits. By augmenting the dataset with these variations, we aim to create a more challenging dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly for tasks like digit recognition and classification. Through this project, we seek to investigate the performance of various machine learning algorithms on this augmented dataset and explore potential improvements in accuracy and robustness.
