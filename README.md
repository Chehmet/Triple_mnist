# Optimizing a Convolutional Neural Network with Genetic Algorithm

We are working with the triple MNIST to distinguish three-digit numbers from MNIST dataset pictures. The provided paper discusses the optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). We explore the adaptation of GA for automated hyperparameter tuning and architectural configuration of CNNs. The method allows for dynamic adjustments of parameters such as filter sizes, number of filters, and batch sizes, and shows promising results in optimizing network performance on image classification tasks.
