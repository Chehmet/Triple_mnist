# Optimizing a Convolutional Neural Network with Genetic Algorithm

We optimized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to classify the MNIST dataset. The provided paper discusses our approach. We explore the adaptation of GA for automated hyperparameter tuning and architectural configuration of CNNs. The method allows for dynamic adjustments of parameters such as filter sizes, number of filters, and batch sizes, and shows promising results in optimizing network performance on image classification tasks. We were also able to achieve an accuracy > 95%. We were able to show that this method can significantly reduce the dependency on manual tuning and accelerate the deployment of efficient models.
