# Optimizing a Convolutional Neural Network with Genetic Algorithm

We are working with the triple MNIST to distinguish three-digit numbers from pictures. The provided paper discusses the optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). We explore the adaptation of GA for automated hyperparameter tuning and architectural configuration of CNNs. The method allows for dynamic adjustments of parameters such as filter sizes, number of filters, and batch sizes, and shows promising results in optimizing network performance on image classification tasks. You can download our project and see how results affirm that Genetic Algorithms can effectively optimize CNN configurations, providing a robust tool for automating neural network design. This method can significantly reduce the dependency on manual tuning and accelerate the deployment of efficient models.
